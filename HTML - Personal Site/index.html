        point of italicizing words, using <i> would just stylistically change the
         words; the way they look, it doesn't actually do anything. In addition to
         this, a better way of putting it is that, emphasis is a logical state and
         italic is a physical state-->
        <!--same goes for emboldening words; we should use <strong></strong> over
         <b></b> as it means more logically-->
        <!--<a></a> is the anchor element, href=___ is where you put the link destination,
       and you put the text you want underlined in blue after the opening tag -->
